The integration of LINCS perturbation data with other datasets will help us unravel the mode of action (MOA) of perturbations which is expected not to become readily possible to obtain by processing the LINCS data alone. Understanding and extracting new knowledge from MOA network models created from LINCS data integrated with other resources will facilitate drug repositioning strategies, identification of new drugs and targets, as well as help in predicting deleterious effects of relevant perturbations. Our data science projects will address methodological and computational challenges related to such integrative analyses.</p><p>The BD2K-LINCS DCIC has several <a href='http://lincs-dcic.org/#/internal-dsrp#nav' target='_blank'>internal research projects</a> and supports several <a href='http://lincs-dcic.org/#external-dsrp#nav' target='_blank'>external data science research projects</a>, addressing various data integration and intracellular molecular regulatory network challenges.
