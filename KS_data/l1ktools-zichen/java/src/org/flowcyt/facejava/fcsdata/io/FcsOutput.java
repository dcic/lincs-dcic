 * are the Parameters contained in the DataRetriever returned by Population.getRetriever().

 * This interface is a generic facade between the FCSData classes and a library which can
 * handle writing FCS files. Each implementation of the interface will use their library to
 * write out the FCS file. Each implementation may have special restrictions on the created FCS
 * file. See their comments.
