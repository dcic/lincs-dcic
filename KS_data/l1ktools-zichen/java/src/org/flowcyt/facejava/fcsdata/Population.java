 * the population is related to the parent in some way (e.g., a subset).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that order of Events <i>may</i> matter. So (where possible) Events should be used in
 * the order returned by the collection's iterator. For Populations with order, they
 * should implement List&lt;Event&gt;.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although, in most cases, Populations are not modifiable (as it makes normally makes
 * no sense to be able to add arbitrary Events to a Population), it is not
 * enforced by the interface. Modifying methods in Unmodifiable populations will 
 * throw UnsupportedOperationExceptions (as specified in the Collections framework).
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Population contains a default DataRetriever which should be used whenever event
 * data needs to be retrieved from that Population.
