              <h3>Join us at the University of Miami for the first Systems Biology Data Science Symposium!              </h3>

              <p>The BD2K-LINCS DCIC and the University of Miami will host the two-day <strong>Systems Biology Data Science Symposium (SBDSS 2016)</strong> on <strong>January 19-20, 2016</strong>.

              <p>The <a href="http://commonfund.nih.gov/LINCS/index" target="blank">Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)</a> consortium is a NIH Common Fund program to create a systems biology reference resource including a "library" of molecular signatures, such as changes in gene expression and other cellular phenotypes that occur when cells are exposed to a variety of perturbing agents, and computational tools for data integration, access, and analysis. The <a href="http://www.lincsproject.org/" target="blank">LINCS program</a> consists of six <a href="http://www.lincsproject.org/centers/data-and-signature-generating-centers/" target="blank">LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers</a> and the <a href="/#/about#nav" target="blank">BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)</a>, which operates in synergy with the <a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/bd2k" target="blank">NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) consortium</a>.</p>
              
	      <p>This first Systems Biology Data Science Symposium at the University of Miami will bring together the BD2K-LINCS DCIC, local researchers, and outside experts who apply or develop computational systems biology resources. In presentations of local experts, invited guests and our Center, a poster reception and several working sessions we want to show the <a href="/#/resources" target="blank">tools/resources</a> and <a href="/#/about#nav" target="blank">scientific projects</a> at the DCIC, connect developers with users, initiate new collaborations and to obtain feedback from expert and casual users of computational systems biology resources. Another important goal of our Center is <a href="/#/training" target="blank">outreach and education</a> and we invite undergraduate/graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in the symposium.</p>
