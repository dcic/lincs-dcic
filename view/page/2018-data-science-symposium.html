        <h3>Studying Systems Biology by Cellular Perturbations</h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="/" target="_blank">
          BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)</a>
	  and the <a href="http://welcome.miami.edu/">University of Miami</a> present the third annual <a href="http://ccs.miami.edu/2nd-annual-systems-biology-data-science-symposium-2018/">BD2K-LINCS Data Science Symposium (DSS 2018)</a> on <strong>January 31 - February 2, 2018</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This annual symposium brings together experts in systems biology, data science, drug discovery
          and translational medicine from academia, industry and government to present their latest research and exchange new ideas and approaches in data driven biomedical research. The general theme of the symposium
          is the study of complex biological systems using large-scale cellular perturbation profiling and applications in drug development, translational biomedicine and environmental health. Talks will address a range of issues related to leveraging
          Big Data in translational research including integration, visualization, access, sharing, and reuse of data, software tools and the emerging NIH Big Data ecosystem. The program also provides
	  a survey of data science research pertaining to the <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/bd2k">BD2K (Big Data
		  to Knowledge)</a> and <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/LINCS">LINCS (Library of Network-Based Cellular
		  Signatures)</a> consortia.
        </p>
	 <p>
            The symposium is organized by the BD2K-LINCS DCIC, the U54 center
	    is jointly funded by NIH BD2K and LINCS programs (U54HL127624) and with support from the <a href="http://ccs.miami.edu/">Center for Computational Science</a> and the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.
            The objective of the DCIC is to apply state of the art data science
            principles and methods in stewarding, integrating and analyzing
	    data generated by the <a href= "http://www.lincsproject.org/">LINCS project</a> and related resources.</p>
