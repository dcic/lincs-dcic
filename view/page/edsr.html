        <h2>BD2K-LINCS DCIC External Data Science Research Projects</h2>
        <h4>REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is soliciting applications from the scientific community for data science research collaborations with the DCIC that focus on mining and integrating data generated by the LINCS program for new scientific discovery. The overarching goal of this solicitation is to maximize the value of LINCS data and transform it into new knowledge. Suitable research topics may include, but are not limited to: new approaches for data visualization and data mining; data integration and comparison with non-LINCS data; computational modeling of LINCS data.</p>
        <p>Details about the LINCS project including the types of data currently available as well as anticipated data release timelines are available on this page. The DCIC, via a subcontract, will support collaboration projects with a budget limit of $130K in total costs per year for up to two years.</p>
        <p>It is expected that awardees will agree to the data and tools sharing goals of the BD2K Project as outlined in the BD2K-LINCS RFA (RFA-HG-14-001) and standards developed by the BD2K program (<a href="http://bd2k.nih.gov" target="_blank">http://bd2k.nih.gov</a>)</p>
        <h3>Scope of the Projects</h3>
        <p>The proposed project should clearly articulate how, if successful, it will enhance the value of the LINCS data to the community. Experimental validation of the results of the data science efforts is not required, but, can be proposed. However, funds for any such experimental work cannot be requested as part of this proposal. Information about the LINCS data sets (currently available, and in process of being generated) along with description of the scientific aims from the LINCS and DCIC PIs are available on the http://www.lincs-dcic.org.</p>
        <p>Examples of potential projects include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Processing and analysis of imaging data or integration of imaging data with other data modalities</li>
            <li>Methods for integration and analysis of datasets from across regulatory layers</li>
            <li>Utilization of machine learning methods that link molecular data with cell and organism phenotypic data</li>
            <li>Methods that integrate LINCS data with other datasets to enable specific translational goals</li>
            <li>Dynamical models of iPS cells and cellular engineering with small molecules</li>
            <li>Utilization of crowdsourcing technologies to integrate and analyze large-scale molecular, imaging and phenotypic data</li>
            <li>Advance web-technologies for data search and visualization</li>
            <li>Collaborations on development of ontologies, metadata annotation, and data standards for data management of LINCS data</li>
            <li>Integration of LINCS data with other publicly available large data resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, other innovative approaches for dealing with Big Data science and are related to LINCS will be considered. Please note that if your proposal is solely focused on transcriptomics data, it would have to be particularly innovative.</p>
        <h3>Point of Access to LINCS Data</h3>
        <p>To learn more about the LINCS project and the data that is collected by the LINCS Data Signature Generation Centers (DSGCs) and the activities of BD2K-LINCS DCIC, potential applicants should refer to <a href="http://www.lincsproject.org/" target="_blank">this page</a>. Pre-existing collaborations with the LINCS centers is not a requirement for a successful application. However, the applicant should demonstrate sufficient familiarity with the data types and other relevant experimental constraints.</p>
        <h3>Solicitation Procedures</h3>
        <p>The NIH LINCS project team and the PIs plan to advertise this opportunity in a coordinated manner with the aim of disseminating it widely to the biomedical research community.</p>
        <h3>Application Instructions</h3>
        <p>The application must be written in a 5 page document including figures and tables. The first page must contain the Specific Aims. The remaining pages are reserved for the description of the research strategy.</p>
        <p>Font must be Arial 11 or higher, margins must be set to “Narrow”, and spacing between text lines must be set to “Single” in Microsoft Word. References can be listed as additional pages.</p>
        <p>Detailed budget for the first and second year and biographical sketches of the key investigators must be provided using <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.html" target="_blank">PHS 398 form</a> pages 4 and 5 and the Biographical Sketch Format Page as provided <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/424/SF424R-R_biosketch_VerC.docx">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The assembled application should be submitted as a single PDF file. Applications that do not adhere to these guidelines will be rejected.</p>
        <h3>Review Process</h3>
        <p>The applications will not undergo a full NIH peer review. It will be treated like Administrative Supplements (as described <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-14-077.html" target="_blank">here</a>) but supplemented with a mail review. NIH Project Team will first evaluate scope and responsiveness. A fair review process organized by the NIH Project Team will be established by recruiting impartial mail reviewers. These mail reviewers will be asked to provide brief summary statements evaluating Significance, Innovation, and Approach. The final decision will be made by a formal discussion between the LINCS steering committee, NIH scientific officers, and the LINCS External Scientific Panel and will be guided by the written reviews and programmatic balance.</p> 
        <h3>Award Budget</h3>
        <p>Budget requests should be suitable to support funds for one postdoctoral fellow (or equivalent) including travel to one of the annual LINCS or BD2K meetings. We expect that total costs are limited to a maximum of $130K in each year</p>
        <h3>Award Project Period</h3>
        <p>The maximum project period is for 2 years. There will be no renewals.</p>
