        <div class="col-md-8">
		<p>The 2020 Summer Research Training Program in Biomedical Big Data Science is a <strong>research intensive ten-week training program for undergraduate and graduate students</strong> interested in participating in cutting edge research projects aimed at solving data-intensive biomedical problems. Summer fellows training in the <strong>Ma'ayan Laboratory at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City</strong> will conduct faculty-mentored independent research projects in the following areas: <strong>data harmonization</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>cloud computing</strong>  <strong>and dynamic data visualization</strong>.</p>
	    <p>The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center supports data science research focused on developing methods that would further extract knowledge from <a href="http://lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu/dcic-portal/" target="_blank">LINCS data</a> by integrating LINCS data with other relevant resources. Our data science projects will address methodological and computational challenges related to such integrative analyses.</p>
