        <div class="col-md-8">
	    <p>The BD2K-LINCS DCIC Summer Research Training Program in Biomedical Big Data Science is a <strong>research intensive ten-week training program for undergraduate and graduate students</strong> interested in participating in cutting edge research projects aimed at solving data-intensive biomedical problems. Summer fellows conduct faculty-mentored independent research projects within laboratories affiliated with the Center in the following areas: <strong>data integration</strong>, <strong>dynamic data visualization</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>data harmonization</strong>, <strong>computational drug discovery</strong>, <strong>metadata and APIs</strong>, <strong>knowledge modeling</strong>, <strong>Bayesian networks and statistical mining</strong>.</p>
	    <p>The DCIC supports data science research focused on developing methods that would further extract knowledge from <a href="http://www.lincsproject.org/data/data-releases/" target="_blank">LINCS data</a> by integrating LINCS data with other relevant resources. Our data science projects will address methodological and computational challenges related to such integrative analyses.</p>
            <p>In summer session 2017, our research training program is offered at the three laboratories affiliated wtih our NIH-funded Center:</p>
