        <h3> Systems Biology of Cellular Perturbations</h3>
        <p>
          The <a href="http://lincs-dcic.org" target="_blank">
          BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)</a>
          held the second annual BD2K-LINCS Data Science Symposium
          (DSS 2017) on May 16-18, 2017.
        </p>

        <p>
          The symposium brought together data scientists and translational
          scientists from academia, industry and government to discuss uses
          of big data in biomedicine. The general theme of the symposium
          was the systems biology of perturbation signatures and applications
          in drug development, translational biomedicine and environmental
          health. Talks addressed a range of issues related to leveraging
          Big Data in translational research including FAIR data principles
          and the emerging NIH Big Data ecosystem. The program also provided
          a survey of data science research pertaining to BD2K (Big Data
          to Knowledge) and LINCS (Library of Network-Based Cellular
          Signatures) consortia.
        </p>

        <p>
          The symposium featured invited talks, poster session, and selected
          poster presentation sessions. A special session on Big Data in
          Environmental Health was held in the afternoon of May 16. For the
          list of invited speakers please refer to the

        <h4>Funding</h4>
          <p>
            The symposium was organized by the BD2K-LINCS DCIC, the U54 center
            is jointly funded by NIH BD2K and LINCS programs (U54HL127624).
            The objective of the DCIC is to apply state of the art data science
            principles and methods in stewarding, integrating and analyzing
            data generated by the LINCS project. The session on Big Data in
            Environmental Health was co-sponsored by the Center for
            Environmental Genetics (ES06096).
